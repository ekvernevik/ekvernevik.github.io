```python
print("Hello, world!")
``` 
```
>>> Hello, world!
```

What better way to employ new code than to have it greet the world? None, I say. I'm very excited to fill this portfolio with the dataprojects I've done up until now, especially the most recent assignments in computational physics.

Looking forward to where this goes!
